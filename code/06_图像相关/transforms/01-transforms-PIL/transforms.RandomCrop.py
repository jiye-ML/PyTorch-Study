CLASStorchvision.transforms.RandomCrop(size, padding=None, pad_if_needed=False, fill=0, padding_mode='constant')[SOURCE]
Crop the given PIL Image at a random location.

Parameters
size (sequence or int) – Desired output size of the crop. If size is an int instead of sequence like (h, w), a square crop (size, size) is made.

padding (int or sequence, optional) – Optional padding on each border of the image. Default is None, i.e no padding. If a sequence of length 4 is provided, it is used to pad left, top, right, bottom borders respectively. If a sequence of length 2 is provided, it is used to pad left/right, top/bottom borders, respectively.

pad_if_needed (boolean) – It will pad the image if smaller than the desired size to avoid raising an exception. Since cropping is done after padding, the padding seems to be done at a random offset.

fill – Pixel fill value for constant fill. Default is 0. If a tuple of length 3, it is used to fill R, G, B channels respectively. This value is only used when the padding_mode is constant

padding_mode –

Type of padding. Should be: constant, edge, reflect or symmetric. Default is constant.

constant: pads with a constant value, this value is specified with fill

edge: pads with the last value on the edge of the image

reflect: pads with reflection of image (without repeating the last value on the edge)

padding [1, 2, 3, 4] with 2 elements on both sides in reflect mode will result in [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2]

symmetric: pads with reflection of image (repeating the last value on the edge)

padding [1, 2, 3, 4] with 2 elements on both sides in symmetric mode will result in [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
