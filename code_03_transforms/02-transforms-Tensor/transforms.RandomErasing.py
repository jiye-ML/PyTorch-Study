torchvision.transforms.RandomErasing(p=0.5, scale=(0.02, 0.33), ratio=(0.3, 3.3), value=0, inplace=False)[SOURCE]
Randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels.
‘Random Erasing Data Augmentation’ by Zhong et al. See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04896.pdf

Parameters
p – probability that the random erasing operation will be performed.

scale – range of proportion of erased area against input image.

ratio – range of aspect ratio of erased area.

value – erasing value. Default is 0. If a single int, it is used to erase all pixels. If a tuple of length 3, it is used to erase R, G, B channels respectively. If a str of ‘random’, erasing each pixel with random values.

inplace – boolean to make this transform inplace. Default set to False.

Returns
Erased Image.

# Examples:
>>> transform = transforms.Compose([
>>> transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
>>> transforms.ToTensor(),
>>> transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406), (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
>>> transforms.RandomErasing(),
>>> ])
