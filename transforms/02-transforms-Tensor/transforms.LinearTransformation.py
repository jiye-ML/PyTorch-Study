CLASStorchvision.transforms.LinearTransformation(transformation_matrix, mean_vector)[SOURCE]
Transform a tensor image with a square transformation matrix and a mean_vector computed offline. Given transformation_matrix and mean_vector, will flatten the torch.*Tensor and subtract mean_vector from it which is then followed by computing the dot product with the transformation matrix and then reshaping the tensor to its original shape.

Applications:
whitening transformation: Suppose X is a column vector zero-centered data. Then compute the data covariance matrix [D x D] with torch.mm(X.t(), X), perform SVD on this matrix and pass it as transformation_matrix.

Parameters
transformation_matrix (Tensor) – tensor [D x D], D = C x H x W

mean_vector (Tensor) – tensor [D], D = C x H x W
