CLASStorchvision.transforms.Pad(padding, fill=0, padding_mode='constant')[SOURCE]
Pad the given PIL Image on all sides with the given “pad” value.

Parameters
padding (int or tuple) – Padding on each border. If a single int is provided this is used to pad all borders. If tuple of length 2 is provided this is the padding on left/right and top/bottom respectively. If a tuple of length 4 is provided this is the padding for the left, top, right and bottom borders respectively.

fill (int or tuple) – Pixel fill value for constant fill. Default is 0. If a tuple of length 3, it is used to fill R, G, B channels respectively. This value is only used when the padding_mode is constant

padding_mode (str) –

Type of padding. Should be: constant, edge, reflect or symmetric. Default is constant.

constant: pads with a constant value, this value is specified with fill

edge: pads with the last value at the edge of the image

reflect: pads with reflection of image without repeating the last value on the edge

For example, padding [1, 2, 3, 4] with 2 elements on both sides in reflect mode will result in [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2]

symmetric: pads with reflection of image repeating the last value on the edge

For example, padding [1, 2, 3, 4] with 2 elements on both sides in symmetric mode will result in [2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
